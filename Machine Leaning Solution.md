**Comment**: 

 *The PRML homework has official answer in pdf. [here](http://read.pudn.com/downloads157/ebook/699944/Pattern%20Recognition%20and%20Machine%20Learning%20(Solution%20Manual)%20-%20Bishop.pdf).  But is is too simple to understand it, so I write it in details.  However, it doesn't conclude all the problems.*
